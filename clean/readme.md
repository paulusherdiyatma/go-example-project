## **cmd/** 
This folder typically contains the main application entry point or executable files. It contains an example-app folder, represents a specific application within the project. The main.go file inside this folder is where the main logic of the application resides.

## **internal/** 
This folder is commonly used to store internal packages or modules that are specific to the project and not intended to be imported by external packages. It helps to organize the project's codebase and enforce encapsulation. In your project, it contains subfolders such as adapters/, databases/, entities/, interfaces/, and usecases/.

### **adapters/**
This folder typically contains code that adapts or converts data from one format to another. In the project, it contains a dbpostgres folder, represents an adapter for interacting with a PostgreSQL database. The repository.go file inside this folder contains common database repository functionality, while the product_repository.go and user_repository.go files contains specific repository implementations for products and users.

### **databases/**
This folder is commonly used to store code related to database connections and configurations. In the project, the postgres.go file contains code for establishing a connection to a PostgreSQL database.

### **entities/**
This folder contains code that represents the core entities or models of the application. In the project, the product.go and user.go files define the structures and behavior of product and user entities respectively.

### **interfaces/**
This folder contains code that defines interfaces or contracts for interacting with different parts of the application. In the project, the product_repository.go and user_repository.go files define interfaces for product and user repositories respectively, specifying the methods that need to be implemented by any concrete repository.

### **usecases/**
This folder contains code that implements the business logic or use cases of the application. In the project, the product_usecase.go and user_usecase.go files likely contain the implementation of use cases related to products and users respectively.
